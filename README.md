# NBA Injury Prediction Project

This project explores the use of data science and machine learning to predict injury risk among NBA players. Using historical player stats and injury records from 2013 to 2023, I developed a workflow that includes:

- Data wrangling and cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Predictive modeling (e.g., Random Forest)  
- Interpretation and insights
